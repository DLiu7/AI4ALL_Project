# (UPDATE IN README.md) Project Title

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Briefly describe the purpose/result(s) of your project, the skills you applied, and the AI4ALL Ignite program.

*EXAMPLE:*
*Uncovered and meticulously analyzed three distinct biases present in ChatGPT, employing advanced Python techniques and data analysis methodologies, all within AI4ALL's cutting-edge AI4ALL Ignite accelerator.*


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

Describe the motivation for this project, why it is relevant, and what its impacts are.

Rapid and accurate human detection in aerial images is crucial for search and rescue (SAR) operations, where every minute can be the difference between life and death. Traditional manual analysis of drone footage is time-consuming, error-prone, and creates dangerous delays during emergency situations. The lack of automated detection systems forces SAR teams to rely on labor-intensive manual processes that can delay life-saving interventions and waste critical resources during search operations.

## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)
Enumerate the main results of this project in a list and describe them.

*EXAMPLE:*
1. *Recorded over 1,000 unique prompts and their responses generated by ChatGPT*
2. *Identified three biases in ChatGPT's responses*
   - *When prompted about this world event*
   - *When prompted about this field of science*
   - *When prompted about this political party*


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

(UPDATE IN README.md)

*EXAMPLE:*
*To accomplish this, we utilized the OpenAI API to interact with ChatGPT, and we designed a custom Python script to generate diverse prompts and collect corresponding responses. The data was then processed and analyzed using pandas, enabling us to detect patterns and biases in the AI model's outputs.*
*Engineered a Python script to generate over 1,000 prompts and elicit their responses from ChatGPT, utilizing pandas to collect the data. When prompted for solutions to this specific relevant crisis, nearly 80% of ChatGPT's responses promoted a certain worldview.*
